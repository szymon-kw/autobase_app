# AutoBaseApp

## General information
AutoBase is a simple web application that allows users to add cars to a database and rate them. It features a registration and login system (users are divided into three types - administrator, editor, and regular user). The application is continuously evolving, with plans to add new features in the future (such as the ability to add comments, introduce pagination, allow editing of car data and other). In addition, Iâ€™m planning to add tests.
